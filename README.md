Just Cause 3 - Multiplayer (Xonos-Utils) **Alpha**

* This project is intended to become a suite of useful server administrative utilities & in-game features that simplify otherwise tedious tasks.

- Please note that this is extremely alpha with some relatively buggy code-work. Please get with me on JC3MP Discord ( https://discordapp.com/invite/0gyoeMRbp166GviN ) if you would like to recommend or submit fixes/additions to this package. Thank you very much! - Xonos

[Currently Available Features]
- **Teleport Menu**
	The teleport menu is bound to the 'B' key and there is no handling of the mouse cursor. It is currently recommended to first press "V" and then "B" to see the mouse.
